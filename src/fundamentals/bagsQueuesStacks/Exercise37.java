 * @comment: Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire straits
 * and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange themselves in a circle
 * (at positions numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle, eliminating every Mth person
 * until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid
 * being eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that takes N and M from the command line and
 * prints out the order in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in
 * the circle). % java Josephus 7 2 :- 1 3 5 0 4 2 6
